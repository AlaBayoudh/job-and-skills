    "- After speaking with JobSnow team we decided to fix the length of the skills to 3 words maximum, this provided us with **7605** skills with 3 words or less, and **5849** skills with more than 3.\n",
    "- We applied our algorithm on the **5849** skills, in the link bellow you will find the result of reduction on those preferred labels with 3 seprate ways of reduction (sheet : Reduction 3 separate ways)\n",
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tE5zjc2AGhNyeq-0jMC0SPNfjPNXBomAOjJ8E5LEJoI/edit#gid=1171303857\n",
    "- After this step we checked from those skills which ones were still composed of more than 3 words, so we had **692** that we needed to handle manually (sheet :more than 3 words and not reduced skills) .\n",
    "- We didn't include the alternative labels because we feared of the duplicates that it will introduce if we included them, the idea was to consider each reduced form as a new skill, but since alternative labes represents a bigger data set and to test the efficency of our rule base reduction algorithm we applied it on them, the results we found were encouraging, from 60K altenrative appelations we had 47K composed with more than 3 words, after applying our rule based alogrithm, it throwed an exception once because of a very badly formulated skill, but reduced 42K of skills this means  we reached a 90% of reduction. (sheet : Reduction of Alt Labels 3 separate ways).\n",
    "- Les't get back to the preferred labels since we're only using them, after the reduction we found out that the most efficent way was the use of \"compound nouns\"(Preferred labels reduced by compound nouns : 3519,All preferred labels : 5848)\n",
    "- Dobj method uses the first verb of the phrase to catch a direct object inside it(Preferred labels reduced by direct object : 2103,All preferred labels : 5848), we figured that we needed to change the verbs format since skills generaly are defined with nouns(ex :linkedin), for example it's a smother to say \"Team management\" than \"manage team\". The problem we faced is that we don't have a specific rule, to figure if the verb needs to end with \"ing\", like for \"mine oil\" --> \"oil mining\" or with \"ment\" like the previous example. so we decided to do it manually to be assured of the trustworthiness.(sheet : Dobj skills verbs to nouns)\n",
    "- All the stats,visualisations and more examples for the reduction could be found in the **\"visualize skill reduction\"** jupoyter notebook.\n",
    "- After this we focused on the bigger part of our data set, the **7605** skills that have 3 words or less, the verbs problem apears once again since ESCO method to define skills is the use of verbs at the begining in the infinitive form, so same as for Dobj we modified these skills manually (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wX7JsJpUzOa7ux7eUy-ItjXmHlMYtPtQD74p8y6Xqyg/edit#gid=2089402)\n",
    "- We merged all outputs from the reduction methods with other sources of technical and hard skills such as StackOver flow tags and a Wikipedia page containing programming languages (treated in other notebooks)\n"
